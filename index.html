                <h2>Our Curious and Fluffy Pets</h2>
                <p>Counting more than half a billion individuals and over 70 different breeds, cats are the world's most popular pets. Even though they are curious animals who like to explore and hunt, cats are also a truly social species. They communicate with humans through mewing, purring or sometimes grunting, and it is possible to even learn cat-specific body language to better understand their needs and wishes.</p>

                <h2>TOP 3 CAT BREEDS</h2>
                <p><b>Siamese:</b> Popular since the 19th century, this cat breed originated in Thailand (formerly known as Siam). The Siamese has been a foundational breed for the Oriental shorthair, sphynx, and Himalayan. Most Siamese cats have distinct markings called "points" that are the areas of coloration on their face, ears, feet, and tail.</p>
                <p><b>Persian:</b> Also lovingly referred to as one of the "smushed-face" cats, the Iranian cat, or Shiraz cat (named for a city in Iran), Persians have beautiful, long fur coats. They can come in almost any color and have a flat face when compared to most other breeds of cats.</p>
                <p><b>Maine Coon:</b> Known for its large stature and thick fur coat, the Maine coon is a cat that is difficult to ignore. Hailing from the state of Maine and the state's official cat, the Maine coon is a gentle giant. They are great hunters and were popularized after the CFA recognized them as purebred in the late 1970s.</p>
                <p>The domestic cat <i>— your cat —</i> has, from its evolutionary origins in Africa, been transformed in comparatively little time into one of the most successful and diverse species on the planet. Jonathan Losos, writing as both a scientist and a cat lover, explores how researchers today are unraveling the secrets of the cat, past and present, using all the tools of modern technology, from GPS tracking (you’d be amazed where those backyard cats roam) and genomics (what is your so-called Siamese cat . . . really?) to forensic archaeology.</p>

                <h2> Play</h2>
                <p>Play assists young kittens’ physical development and coordination. By playing with their siblings they also improve and refine their social and communication skills. As kittens grow older their play changes and by the time they are 14 weeks old their play is mainly directed towards objects, which they stalk, pounce on, bat, grasp and bite. These are the skills they need for hunting. Play provides an outlet for your cat’s predatory instincts and also relieves boredom, prevents behaviour problems and provides exercise which reduces weight gain and future health problems. This is especially important for cats without access outdoors.</p>

            <div class="work-text">
                <h2> Medical</h2>
                <p>Vaccination is a key component of preventive medicine in cats, just as in dogs and people. Vaccinations are given to stimulate the immune system against infection before exposure to disease. Several vaccines are routinely given to cats as the core defense against serious infectious illness (for example, panleukopenia, herpesvirus). Several others (-referred to as noncore) are important in certain regions and situations (for example, feline leukemia virus). Your veterinarian can advise which vaccines are recommended in your local area and circumstances.</p>

                <h2> Adopt</h2>
                <p>When everyone is happy that your chosen cat or kitten is the right one for you, and that your home is suitable and ready for its newest addition, it's time to head back to the centre to have your new family member officially signed over! Your centre should give you a blanket or other item from your cat's pod which will help them feel at ease whilst travelling to their new home. We've got lots of great advice on caring for your new cat, including providing a safe environment, looking after a kitten and understanding cat behaviour.</p>

                <h2>PRICING</h2>
                <p>The ASPCA also adds in $30 for miscellaneous costs for other things, such as catnip or an extra scratching mat. Obviously, these costs can range widely depending on the brands you choose and your cat's individual needs. In addition, you may have other expenses depending on your lifestyle. For instance, you may need to hire someone to come by and check on your cat if you work long hours.</p>
